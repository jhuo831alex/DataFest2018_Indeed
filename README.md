# About the Project
The main goal of this project is to maximize Indeed's revenue by increasing number of clicks of job postings. As Indeed's business model is PayPerClick, we access the potential value of a job upon posting and correspondingly optimize job posting rank.

# Methodology
* Data was provided by [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) (data size: 2.58GB)
* Engineered KPIs to evaluate the potential value of a job posting 
* Integrated the KPIs into one
* Implemented XGBoost regression to derive significant features and corresponding weights for the integrated KPI
* Computed potential values to any future job postings (score 0-100)
* Optimized job posting ranks for indeed.com

This project was done in 48 hours, and was presented to statisticians and Indeed data scientists. <br />
